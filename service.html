                    <p class="servicetext">I am a member of the Texas A&M University, Engineers Without Borders where I collaborate with other students
                        to develop solutions for real world problems to communities all around the world. As a freshman, I participated 
                        in the FIELD project, where I helped design and develop a pergola structure for a local community near campus. 
                        This year, I am a part of the Dominican Republic project which aims to develop drainage and road system 
                        for Villa Verde, a community near the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo. For this project, I have collected 
                        and recorded the water flow and elevation of different spots in the community. 
                        Also this year, I because the Travel Director of EWB. As the organization's travel director, 
                        I spearhead travel planning and booking the trips to visit our two international projects in Rwanda and 
                        Dominican Republic. Likewise, I communicate with our local contacts, book flights, set itineraries, 
                        find local transportation and housing, and plan fun excursions, while managing the trip budget. This summer, 
                        I hope to be one of the eight students to travel to the Dominican Republic with EWB. </p>

                    <p class="servicetext">For a about ten weeks each summer for three years, I was a summer camp counselor at Camp Can-Aqua.
                        Every two weeks, I would get a group of about ten younger girls that I had to take care of for the entire
                        two weeks that we were together. I had to get them up, take them to meals, make sure they cleaned and had fun, 
                        help them sleep, and just ensure they had a great time. My job was to teach the girls the responsibility of taking care of
                        themselves as it was one of the first times they would be away from their parents for extended periods of time.
                        More importantlly, I was the counselor in charge of the camp crafting activities in which I taught kids "survival skills." I
                        would spend hours convincing them to persevere and collect enough wood to light fires, and I taught them to cook Mac and 
                        Cheese over their fire, to sharpen knives, and to create shelters and traps with just dirt and sticks. 
                        Most of these activities required the kids to have a lot of patience and perseverance, but after they completed each task they felt so proud of the idea that they would be able
                        to survive in the wild by themselves.</p>
